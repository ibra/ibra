Hi. I'm a 15 year old **programmer** and hobbyist **indie game developer**  from Pakistan üáµüá∞. I mostly work with C#, Rust and Typescript.

Here are a few projects of mine that may be of note:

- [Ibralogue](https://github.com/ibra/Ibralogue) - a dialogue library for Unity written in **C#**.
- [snip](https://github.com/harshhhdev/snip) - the minimalistic yet powerful pastebin which i wrote the backend for in **Rust**.
- [BotMyst](https://github.com/BotMyst/BotMystRevival) - a general purpose utility bot for Discord written in **TypeScript**.
- [blog](https://github.com/ibra/blog) - my own personal blog website made with the static site generator **Zola**.

I also write [blog posts](https://ibra.github.io) and sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/IbrahDev) about things.

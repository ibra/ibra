I mostly work with **Unity**, and am currently working on a smol **tower-defense** game.


Here are a few of my projects that are worth mentioning:

- [Ibralogue](https://github.com/ibra/Ibralogue) - A dialogue library for Unity written in **CSharp**.
- [BotMyst](https://github.com/BotMyst/BotMystRevival) - A general purpose utility bot for Discord in **Javascript**.
- [snippy](https://github.com/ibra/snippy) - a simple command-line tool to shorten your links utilizing the sniplink api written in **Rust**.
- [blog](https://github.com/ibra/blog) - A blog website made in Hugo, an *epic* fast web framework written in **Go**.
<br> 

My main project is [YourShot](https://playyourshot.com), a unique blend between JRPG and Top-Down shooter. I also write [blog posts](https://ibrahim.thedev.id) and sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/minidevz) about things.

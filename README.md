### Ibrahim | ÿßÿ®ÿ±ÿß€Å€åŸÖ

I'm a 15 year **programmer** and hobbyist **indie game developer**  from Pakistan üáµüá∞. I mostly work with C#, Rust and Typescript.

Here are a few projects of mine that may be of note:

- [Ibralogue](https://github.com/ibra/Ibralogue) - A dialogue library for Unity written in **C#**.
- [snippy](https://github.com/ibra/snippy) - a simple command-line utility to shorten links written in **Rust**.
- [BotMyst](https://github.com/BotMyst/BotMystRevival) - A general purpose utility bot for Discord in **TypeScript**.
- [blog](https://github.com/ibra/blog) - A personal blog website made with the static site generator **Zola**.

I also write [blog posts](https://ibra.github.io) and sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/IbrahDev) about things.
